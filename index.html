<h4> About Us <h4>
  <p>Munder Difflin is a paper supply company based in the northwest region of Pennsylvania founded in 2005. As it currently stands, we have approximately 200 employees with decades of experience in the paper business between them and 12 branches across the wonderful state of Pennsylvania!

As we were originally a family run business, Munder Difflin places a great deal of importance on treating every customer with the upmost respect and care. Most of the time to get such tremendous customer service you have to sacrafice the access to resources that a larger company may have. That is not the case with Munder Difflin Paper Inc. Because of some of our high volume clients, we are able to afford to put time into ensuring our customers have access to resources they would be able to get with a larger supplier. </p>
    <h4> Our Company Goals </h4>
    <p>the most critical aspect of success in any organization. Think of it in terms of football: if there wasn’t an end zone, how would you know when your team scored a touchdown? Goals are the end zones of the business world, and you need to be tracking your progress with them to make sure you’re staying ahead of the competition.

Of course, this is an over-simplified comparison, but it may be helpful for shedding light on the importance of company goals. The reality is that many executives set them, but fail in terms of follow-through. One of the main reasons they fail is because they’re not measuring progress</p>
